            <h1>New Year</h1>
            <p>
                Almost everywhere celebrates the new year, but the date when the new year starts depends on the calendar
                you use. For example, in the Iranian solar calendar, New Year (Nowruz) is celebrated around 21 March,
                and for Jewish people, New Year is Rosh Hashanah and is celebrated in September or October. The calendar
                which is used the most in the world is called the Gregorian calendar. In this calendar, New Year is on 1
                January. Find out how it's celebrated around the world!
            </p>
            <h1>Midnight fireworks</h1>
            <p>New Year's Eve, 31 December, is the last day of the old year. In many places, people have a party or go
                out in the evening with their friends and family to watch amazing fireworks or light shows. People often
                watch a big clock and count down the last ten seconds (10! 9! 8! â€¦ 3! 2! 1!) before midnight, the moment
                the new year starts, then say 'Happy New Year!'</p>
            <h1>
                Traditions around the world
            </h1>
            <p>There are lots of different traditions in different countries. In some countries, people sing a special
                New Year song. In the UK the song is called 'Auld Lang Syne', and people usually sing it just after
                midnight. In Greece, you can have a piece of a special cake or bread. Inside only one piece of the cake
                or bread is a coin. If you get that piece, you have good luck for the next year!</p><br />
            <p>In other countries, colours are important. In Brazil, for example, people often wear white clothes for
                good luck, yellow clothes for happiness and money or red clothes for love. In the Philippines, circles
                mean coins or money, so people wear clothes with circles and eat 12 round fruits, one for each month of
                the year.</p><br />
            <p>Bells can be important too. In many places, a clock bell rings 12 times at midnight. In Japan, temple
                bells ring 108 times! This is to make sure that there are no negative feelings or ideas, like anger or
                hate, in the new year.</p>
            <h1>New Year's resolutions</h1>
            <p>For lots of people, the New Year is the perfect time to make New Year's resolutions. This means to
                promise yourself to do something good for all the next year. For example, I'm going to eat one more
                piece of fruit or vegetables every day, or I'm going to help my little brother with his homework every
                week. Sometimes it's difficult to keep your resolutions! If you make a resolution, try something small
                that you can easily say 'Yes, I did that today.' Good luck!</p><br />
            <p>New Year is celebrated in so many different ways, but everywhere people are happy and excited for the new
                year and enjoy this time with their friends and family. Happy New Year!</p>
