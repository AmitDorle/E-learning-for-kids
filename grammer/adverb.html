                    <h3>We can use adverbs to describe how somebody does something.</h3><br />

                    <p>I speak English well.</p>
                    <p>He plays hockey badly.</p>
                    <p>We try to do our homework correctly.</p>

                    <h1>How to use them</h1>
                    <h3>To make adverbs, we normally add ly to the adjective. Sometimes the spelling is different.</h3><br />

                    <p>She ran quickly.</p>
                    <p>They sang beautifully.</p>
                    <p>The children are playing happily.</p>
                    <p>I dance terribly.</p>

                    <h3>Some adverbs don't have ly.</h3><br />

                    <p></p>I don't write Italian well.
                    <p></p>My mum drives fast.
                    <p></p>Do you work hard?
