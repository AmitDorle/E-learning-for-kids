                    <h1>Adverbs of frequency</h1>
                    <h3>We can use adverbs of frequency to say how often we do something.</h3>

                    <p>I always go to the cinema at the weekend.</p>
                    <p>She usually has cereal for breakfast.</p>
                    <p>They sometimes watch TV in the evenings.</p>
                    <p>We never go to museums.</p>

                    <h1>How to use them</h1>
                    <h3>Always means every time. Usually means most times. Sometimes means a small number of times. Never means no times.</h3>

                    <p>She always practises the piano in the evenings. Every day!</p>
                    <p>We usually go to the park on Sundays. Most Sundays!</p>
                    <p>They sometimes make a cake. Just for special days!</p>
                    <p>He never forgets his homework. No times!</p>

                    <h3>We usually put the adverb before the verb.</h3>

                    <p>She always does her homework after school.</p>
                    <p>I usually have cereal for breakfast.</p>

                    If the verb is to be, we put the adverb after the verb.

                    <p>They are usually on holiday in July.
                    <p>He is sometimes late for school.

                    <h3>To ask a question, use often or how often.</h3>

                    <p>Does she play football often?
                    <p>How often do you play computer games?
