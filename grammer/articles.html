            <h1>Articles</h1>
            <h3>We can use articles before nouns.</h3>

            <p>I saw a lion and an elephant on safari.</p>
            <p>The lion was scary.</p>

            <h1>How to use them</h1>
            <h3>We use a and an with singular nouns. We use a before a consonant sound and an before a vowel sound.</h3>

            <p>I've got a pencil and an eraser.</p>
            <p>There's a big umbrella and an orange pencil case in my bag.</p>

            <h3>The first time we mention a noun, we use a or an. The next time, we use the.</h3>

            <p>She had a sandwich and an apple for lunch. She didn't like the sandwich.</p>
            <p>We've got an old car. The car is blue.</p>

            <h3>We don't usually use articles for people's names, countries or meals.</h3>

            <p>My best friend is called Mai.</p>
            <p>Is she from Japan?</p>
